# Aurora Elegance WordPress Theme

Aurora Elegance is a luminous, editorial WordPress theme tailored for boutique studios and creative storytellers. The design blends layered gradients, refined typography, and glassmorphism-inspired panels to deliver an immersive browsing experience.

## Highlights

- Hero section with layered gradients, headline highlight, and split layout card
- Feature grid with hover interactions and emoji-based glyphs
- Journal section that surfaces recent posts with card layouts and gradient buttons
- Curated testimonial band with glass panels and quote styling
- Custom search form, pagination, comment template, and responsive navigation
- Editor styles for Gutenberg to mirror the front-end atmosphere
- Accessibility mindful: semantic HTML structure, focus-visible states inherited from browsers, ARIA labels on navigation toggles

## Getting Started

1. Copy the theme directory `aurora-elegance` into your WordPress installation under `wp-content/themes/`.
2. Log in to your WordPress dashboard and activate **Aurora Elegance** under **Appearance → Themes**.
3. Assign menus to the “Primary Menu” and “Footer Menu” locations for navigation.
4. Customize the site title, tagline, and logo via **Appearance → Customize**.
5. Create a static front page and assign it under **Settings → Reading** to experience the crafted homepage layout. Optionally set a posts page to populate the “Explore journal” call-to-action.

## Recommended Plugins

- Contact Form 7 (or any form plugin) to replace the placeholder shortcode in the contact section
- Gutenberg-native blocks for rich layouts and galleries

## Development

The theme loads Google Fonts (Inter and Playfair Display) from the Fonts API. Scripts and styles are versioned via `AURORA_ELEGANCE_VERSION`.

Feel free to extend the design with custom templates, patterns, or WooCommerce support depending on project needs.
